<p>Explore the Eiffel Tower like never before as you climb this monumental tower by foot. Pass the first security check and meet your guide underneath the Tower itself to begin your tour. Here your guide will give you an introduction to the iconic structure before leading you to the ticket entrance and should you have to wait in line for longer than expected your guide will keep you entertained with even more interesting facts and anecdotes. Begin your ascent, hearing stories behind the tower's creation and near demise as you take in the unique views from the staircase.

Take a break on the 1st floor and hear little-known facts about the tower and her architect. Experience the walk on a 57-meter high glass floor to take a few keepsake photos. Continue to the observation deck on the 2nd floor for bird's eye views of the Arc de Triomphe and other icons of Paris. Once you are finished admiring the spectacular views, you can choose to take the stairs or the elevator back to the ground floor. 

Choose to upgrade your ticket to the Summit, only possible at the time of booking, to see Gustave Eiffel's original office and enjoy the highest platform for panoramic views of Paris. Please note that occasionally, due to situations beyond control such as inclement weather or crowds, the summit may be temporarily closed upon your arrival to the Eiffel Tower. In these rare cases, the group will not be able to access the summit, even if it reopens while presently inside the tower. Should this occur, you will receive a refund for the price of summit access within 5-10 days. The refund will be done automatically, so there is no need to contact us.
