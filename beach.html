Beach rock A cemented beach sand deposit that develops within the intertidal zone by the precipitation of needle-like crystals of aragonite in the pore space between the grains. The cementation process is relatively rapid, taking as little as ten years for a lithified rock to develop. The precipitation of the cement is favoured by a warm climate, and may be aided by algal or bacterial action.
A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose particles. The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock, such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles. The particles can also be biological in origin, such as mollusc shells or coralline algae.

Some beaches have man-made infrastructure, such as lifeguard posts, changing rooms, showers, shacks and bars. They may also have hospitality venues (such as resorts, camps, hotels, and restaurants) nearby. Wild beaches, also known as undeveloped or undiscovered beaches, are not developed in this manner. Wild beaches can be appreciated for their untouched beauty and preserved nature.
