<p>Udhagamandalam (Ooty), the "Queen of hill stations" is the  capital of Nilgiri district. It is one of the Best tourist resorts and is called as "Blue Mountains". It is a land of dreams and a picturesque hill station. It is situated at a distance of 105 km away from Coimbatore. The height of the hills in the Nilgiri range varies between 2280 and 2290 meters, the highest peak being Doddabetta at a height of 2623 meters.
This famous hill station is at the junction of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, three southern states of India. British founded this hill resort which seemed them as their summer headquarters. Before that time, the area was inhabited by Todas. These tribal people still inhabit the area, but only around 3000 remain.
What was once a getaway from the steamy summers of the plains for the British elite of the Madras Presidency is now a hill station that caters to weekend holidaymakers from all over the South of India and honeymooners from across the country.
